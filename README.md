# Solr-AzureAppService

[![Deploy to Azure](https://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://azuredeploy.net/)

Install Solr as an App Service in about 10 minutes. Click the button above and follow the prompts. Full credit goes to Dan Cruickshank. His guide was used as the basis for this one-click deployment:

This script sets the `httpsOnly` property to `true` by default, but it can be modified in the parameters (in the prompts).

Verified on Solr 6.6.2 and 7.2.1. 

# Sitecore Solr-AzureAppService

To use this guide for Sitecore development, please see the ReadMe on the Sitecore branch: https://github.com/jraps20/Solr-AzureAppService/tree/Sitecore. The Sitecore branch will create all necessary cores for installation.

## Deployment Summary

1. \[Deploy to Azure\] button looks for `azuredeploy.json` file at repo root
2. `azuredeploy.json` deploys resources. Notable steps listed below:
    1. `solrVersion` parameter is added as an `appSetting` to the web app. This is required to parameterize it when calling `Deploy-SolrAzureAppService.ps1`
    2. `web > config` resource. Sets `javaVersion` to 1.8 which supports all (?) Solr versions
    3. `sourcecontrols` resource. This is the brains of the operation. It deploys THIS repository to your web app.
        1. With this resource deployment, if a file named `.deployment` exists at the repo root, it is executed once the repo has been cloned to your web app
3. The `.deployment` file calls `Deploy-SolrAzureAppService.ps1` with the Solr version as a parameter (parameters are only accessible from the `.deployment` file). 
4. `Deploy-SolrAzureAppService.ps1` is where the majority of work occurs. This is where Dan's manual work was implemented in an automated fashion
    1. This script downloads and extracts the desired Solr version to the web root
    2. It also copies the `web.config` from the repo to the web root
